- 👋 Hi, I’m @LudacrisSpeed420
- 👀 I’m interested in alot of things and ive heard alot about programming verses coding. pros and cons about both really but im interested in anything and all things. I love to learn new things and im a very quick learner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux and how to work KAli ...i think thats it...yea, anyways, im looking to expand my knowledge. Ive applied for schooling at UAT and havent gotten back with them quit yet because i believe i can learn without schooling. Just trial and error can go a long way.
